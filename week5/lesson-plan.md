# Week 1 : Python Introduction & Data Types

## Pre-requisites :

This course has no prerequisites. However, having familiarity with other programming languages can aid in your comprehension of Python.
## Lesson Plan :
### 1.	Syntax :
Syntax refers to the set of rules that dictate how programs written in a programming language should be structured. In Python, syntax governs the arrangement of keywords, operators, punctuation, and other elements to form valid and meaningful statements. A single syntax error, such as a missing or misplaced character, can prevent a program from running successfully.
For example, in Python, using a colon (:) at the end of a line is part of the syntax for defining a code block (e.g., in loops, conditionals, and function definitions). If this colon is omitted, it would result in a syntax error.

### 2.	Comments :
Comments are annotations within your code that are ignored by the Python interpreter when executing the program. They are used to provide explanations, context, or notes to yourself or other developers about how the code works or why certain decisions were made. Comments are not executed as part of the program and don't affect its functionality.

### 3.	Variables :
A variable in Python is a symbolic name that represents a value stored in memory. It serves as a container for holding data, such as numbers, strings, lists, or more complex objects. Variables allow you to store, manipulate, and retrieve data throughout your program.

### 4.	Class Integer :
The int class in Python is used to represent integers, which are whole numbers without any fractional or decimal parts. It's one of the built-in classes provided by Python. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero.

### 5.	Class Float :
The float class in Python is used to represent floating-point numbers, which are numbers that can have fractional parts. Floating-point numbers are used to represent real numbers and can include decimal points or be expressed in scientific notation.

### 6.	Class String :
The str class in Python is used to represent strings, which are sequences of characters. Strings are used to store and manipulate text data, such as words, sentences, and more complex textual information.

### 7.	Class List :
The list class in Python is used to represent ordered collections of items. Lists can contain elements of various data types, and the elements are organized in a specific order based on their positions (indices) within the list. Lists are versatile and widely used for storing and manipulating collections of data.

### 8.	Class Tuple :
The tuple class in Python is used to represent ordered collections of items, similar to lists. However, unlike lists, tuples are immutable, which means their contents cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are often used to group related data together, and their immutability makes them suitable for situations where the data should not be altered.

### 9.	Class Dictionary :
The dict class in Python is used to represent collections of key-value pairs. Each key in a dictionary maps to a specific value. Dictionaries provide a way to store and retrieve data using descriptive keys, making it easy to access values based on their associated labels.

### 10.	Class Set :
The set class in Python is used to represent collections of unique elements. Sets are similar to lists or tuples, but they do not allow duplicate values. Sets are unordered, meaning that the elements are not stored in a specific order like lists or tuples.

### 11.	Class Bool :
In Python, the bool class represents the two truth values: True and False. Booleans are used for logical operations, comparisons, and branching in conditional statements.

### 12.	Casting :
Casting in Python, also known as type conversion or type casting, involves changing the data type of a value from one type to another. This can be useful when you need to perform operations that are only allowed between certain data types or when you want to ensure data consistency in your program. Python provides various built-in functions to perform type casting.
