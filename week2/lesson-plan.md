# Week 2 : Python Operators & If Statements

## Pre-requisites :

This course is designed to be beginner-friendly and assumes no prior programming experience. However, having some familiarity with basic computer concepts and logic can enhance your understanding of the topics covered in this section.

Before delving into the concepts of arithmetic operators, assignment operators, comparison operators, logical operators, identity operators, membership operators, bitwise operators, operator precedence, and control structures, it's helpful to have a grasp of the following foundational concepts:

**Basic Computer Literacy:**
A basic understanding of how computers work, file management, and navigating through operating systems will be beneficial.

**Logical Thinking:**
An ability to think logically and solve problems systematically will be valuable as you learn about programming concepts.

**Mathematical Awareness:**
While the course will cover mathematical concepts as they relate to programming, having familiarity with basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) will be advantageous.

**Text Editors or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):**
It's recommended that you have access to a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) where you can write and execute Python code. Familiarity with navigating and using such tools will be helpful.

As the course progresses, each concept will be introduced with clear explanations and practical examples. The lessons are designed to build upon each other, gradually introducing you to the world of Python programming and guiding you through the various operators and control structures.
Remember that learning to program is a gradual process, and it's absolutely normal to encounter challenges along the way. Stay curious, practice regularly, and don't hesitate to seek help if you encounter difficulties. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid foundation in Python programming that you can continue to build upon.

## Lesson Plan :
### 1.	Arithmetic Operators :
Arithmetic operators are symbols used in Python to perform various arithmetic operations on numbers. They allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations.

### 2.	Assignment Operators :
Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables. They combine an arithmetic operation with assignment, making it more concise to update the value of a variable based on its current value or the value of another variable.

### 3.	Comparison Operators :
Comparison operators in Python are used to compare values and determine the relationship between them. They return a Boolean value (True or False) based on whether the comparison is true or false.

### 4.	Logical Operators :
Logical operators in Python are used to combine or modify the results of comparisons and logical expressions. They allow you to create complex conditions and perform logical operations on Boolean values. There are three main logical operators: and, or, and not.

### 5.	Identity Operators :
Identity operators in Python are used to compare the memory addresses of two objects to determine whether they are the same object or not. They are often used with objects that are mutable, like lists and dictionaries, to understand if two variables reference the same underlying object. There are two identity operators: is and is not.

### 6.	Membership Operators :
Membership operators in Python are used to check whether a value exists within a sequence, such as a string, list, tuple, or set. They return True or False based on whether the value is present or not. There are two membership operators: in and not in.

### 7.	Bitwise Operators :
Bitwise operators in Python are used to perform bitwise operations on the individual bits of integers. These operators work on the binary representation of the numbers, manipulating their individual bits. Bitwise operations are often used in low-level programming, such as hardware interfacing, and for optimizing certain algorithms.

### 8.	Operator Precedence :
Operator precedence in Python determines the order in which operators are evaluated when an expression contains multiple operators. It ensures that expressions are evaluated in a predictable and consistent manner. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.

### 9.	If Structure :
The "if" structure in Python is used for conditional branching, allowing you to execute different code blocks based on the evaluation of a given condition. 

### 10.	Short Hand If :
In Python, you can use a shorthand version of the "if" statement called the "ternary operator" or "conditional expression" to write more concise code for simple conditions. 

### 11.	Short Hand If ... Else :
The shorthand version of the "if...else" statement, often referred to as the ternary operator or conditional expression, allows you to write concise conditional code in a single line. It's useful when you want to assign a value based on a condition.

### 12.	Nested If :
A nested "if" statement in Python is an "if" statement that is placed within another "if" statement. This allows you to create multiple levels of conditions and perform more complex decision-making based on various criteria.
