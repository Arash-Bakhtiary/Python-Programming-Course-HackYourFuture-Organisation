# Week 1 : Python Introduction & Data Types

## Pre-requisites :

This course has no prerequisites. However, having familiarity with other programming languages can aid in your comprehension of Python.
## Lesson Plan :
### 1.	Syntax :
Syntax refers to the set of rules that dictate how programs written in a programming language should be structured. In Python, syntax governs the arrangement of keywords, operators, punctuation, and other elements to form valid and meaningful statements. A single syntax error, such as a missing or misplaced character, can prevent a program from running successfully.
For example, in Python, using a colon (:) at the end of a line is part of the syntax for defining a code block (e.g., in loops, conditionals, and function definitions). If this colon is omitted, it would result in a syntax error.
