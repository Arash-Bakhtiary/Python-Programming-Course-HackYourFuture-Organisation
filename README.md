# HackYourFuture - Python Programming Language Course

In this number_of_weeks week module we will build a MASTERCLASS application from scratch

## Prerequisites

This course has no strict prerequisites. However, having familiarity with basic programming concepts or experience in other programming languages can aid in your comprehension of Python. Some helpful background knowledge might include:
* *Understanding of basic programming concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals.
* *Experience working with any programming language, even at a beginner level.
* *Basic problem-solving skills and logical thinking.
Having said that, this course is designed to be accessible to complete beginners as well, so don't worry if you're new to programming.

## Preparation

Numerous exercises will be provided throughout the course. Some of these exercises will be solved during class sessions, while others are intended for completion during students' independent study time. The scores from these exercises will contribute to the final evaluation and assessment of students. Additionally, quizzes in the form of questions will be posed to students during the course. These quizzes serve to reinforce concepts from previous sessions, and their scores will be factored into the final evaluation.
Towards the conclusion of the course, several projects will be presented. Students are required to select one project from the options provided and submit it as their final project. This final project submission represents a culmination of their learning journey.

## Environment setup

In the initial session, tailored to each student's operating system specifications, essential programs and files required for installation will be provided. During this session, the Python program will be installed on their systems, guided by the instructor.
