# Week 4 : Python Methods

## Pre-requisites :

This course has no prerequisites. However, having familiarity with other programming languages can aid in your comprehension of Python.
## Lesson Plan :
### 1.	Integer Methods :
In Python, integers are objects, and they have associated methods that you can use to perform various operations and manipulations. Here are some common methods that you can use with integers: 
* *int()*
* *constructor*
* *bit_length()*
* *to_bytes()*
* *from_bytes()*
* *__add__(other)*
* *__sub__(other))*
* *__eq__(other)*
* *__lt__(other)*

### 2.	Float Methods :
In Python, floating-point numbers (floats) are objects with associated methods that you can use to perform various operations and manipulations. Here are some common methods that you can use with floating-point numbers: 
**float()*
**constructor*
**is_integer()*
**as_integer_ratio()*
**hex()*
**oct()*
**bin()*
**__add__(other)*
**__sub__(other)*
**__eq__(other)*
**__lt__(other)*

### 3.	String Methods :
Strings in Python are objects with associated methods that allow you to manipulate and perform various operations on text data. Here are some common string methods: 
upper()
lower()
capitalize()
title()
strip()
split()
join()
replace()

### 4.	List Methods :
Lists in Python are versatile data structures that come with various built-in methods for manipulation and manipulation. Here are some common methods you can use with lists: append(item), extend(iterable), insert(index, item), remove(item), pop(index), index(item), count(item), sort(), reverse(), 

### 5.	Dictionary Methods :
Dictionaries in Python are versatile data structures that store key-value pairs. They come with various built-in methods for manipulation and retrieval. Here are some common methods you can use with dictionaries: keys(), values(), items(), get(key, default), pop(key, default), update(other_dict), clear()

### 6.	Set Methods :
Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements. They come with various built-in methods for set operations and manipulation. Here are some common methods you can use with sets: add(item), update(iterable), remove(item), discard(item), pop(), clear(), union(other_set), |, intersection(other_set), &, difference(other_set), -
