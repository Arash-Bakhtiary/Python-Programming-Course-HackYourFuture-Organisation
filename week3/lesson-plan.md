# Week 3 : Python Loops & Functions

## Pre-requisites :

This section of the course focuses on loops and functions, fundamental programming concepts that allow you to create efficient and modular code. Before diving into these topics, it's recommended to have a solid understanding of the following foundational concepts:
Basic Python Syntax: Familiarity with basic Python syntax, data types (such as integers, floats, strings, lists), and how to write and execute Python code is essential as you progress into more advanced programming concepts.

**Variables and Data Manipulation:**
Understanding how to work with variables, assign values, and manipulate data using arithmetic operations will be crucial when working with loops and functions.

**Conditional Statements:**
Having a grasp of conditional statements (such as if, else, and elif) will help you understand the flow of control in programs, which is closely related to loops and functions.

**Basic Mathematical Operations:**
A basic understanding of mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) will be important when working with functions that involve calculations.

**Logical Thinking:**
Developing logical thinking skills will greatly assist you in creating efficient loops and designing effective functions.

**Text Editors or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):**
Having access to a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and execute Python code is recommended for hands-on practice.

As you progress through this section, you'll learn about various loop structures, including while loops and for loops, as well as concepts related to creating and using functions. Each topic will be introduced with clear explanations, examples, and hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding.
Remember that programming is a skill that is best learned through practice and experimentation. Don't be discouraged if you encounter challenges along the wayâ€”persevere and seek assistance when needed. By mastering loops and functions, you'll gain the ability to create dynamic and efficient programs that can solve a wide range of problems.

## Lesson Plan :
### 1.	While Loops :
A "while loop" is a control flow structure in Python (and many other programming languages) that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The loop continues to run as long as the specified condition evaluates to True, and it terminates as soon as the condition becomes False.

### 2.	For Loops :
A "for loop" is a control flow structure in Python (and many other programming languages) that allows you to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as a list, tuple, string, or range. For each element in the sequence, a specified block of code is executed. The for loop continues until all elements in the sequence have been processed.

### 3.	The Break Statement :
The break statement is a control flow statement in Python that allows you to exit out of a loop prematurely, even if the loop's condition hasn't become False or the loop sequence hasn't been exhausted. When the break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop terminates immediately, and the program execution continues with the next statement after the loop.

### 4.	The Continue Statement :
The continue statement is another control flow statement in Python that allows you to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and immediately move to the next iteration. Unlike the break statement, which exits the entire loop, the continue statement only affects the current iteration and does not terminate the loop.

### 5.	Nested Loops :
Nested loops are a concept in programming where you use one loop inside another loop. This allows you to perform more complex and structured iterations, often for tasks that involve multiple levels of iteration. In Python (and most programming languages), you can nest loops of the same type (e.g., nested for loops or nested while loops) or even different types of loops within each other.

### 6.	Creating a Function (Built-in) :
Creating functions in Python allows you to encapsulate a block of code into a reusable and organized structure. Python provides a variety of built-in functions that you can use directly, and you can also create your own functions when you need to perform specific tasks.

### 7.	User-Defined Functions :
User-defined functions in Python are functions that you create yourself to perform specific tasks. These functions allow you to encapsulate a block of code that you can reuse and call multiple times within your program. 

### 8.	Lambda Functions :
Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are a concise way to create small, one-line functions in Python. They are defined using the lambda keyword, and they are often used for simple operations that can be expressed as single expressions. Lambda functions are commonly used when a function is required as an argument to another function, such as in the case of sorting or filtering.

### 9.	Higher-Order Functions (map(), filter(), reduce(), sorted()) :
Higher-order functions in Python are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results. They enable powerful functional programming techniques by allowing you to treat functions as first-class citizens. Four commonly used higher-order functions in Python are map(), filter(), reduce(), and sorted().

### 10.	Recursive Functions :
Recursive functions are functions in Python that call themselves to solve a problem. They provide a way to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler instances of the same problem. 

### 11.	Arguments in Functions : 
In Python, functions can accept arguments, which are values provided to the function when it's called. Arguments allow you to pass data into a function so that it can perform operations on that data.
